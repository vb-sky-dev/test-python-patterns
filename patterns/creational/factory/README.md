# The Factory Method

##### The Factory Method is a design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful for decoupling software components, making it easier to extend and manage by defining a method in a base class, which can be overridden by derived classes to create specific types of objects.
